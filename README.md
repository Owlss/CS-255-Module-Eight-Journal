The owner of DriverPass wants to design a website for training drivers. The client is the owner of Driver Pass and he wants the system built for student drivers to register for a driving course training. They want us to design a system where the users can create their own accounts and choose friving times. The users will be able to get online training by taking online exams and then getting on the road training.

I think I did well on designing and creating my charts. They are clear and make the point I want to come across.

If I could change something I would add more to my requiements that I created. I feel like I could of added more detail to both the finctional and nonfunctional ones.

I interpeted the users need by reading through the interveiw and taking notes. I then used those notes to build the fondation of my system. It is important to conider the users needs when building a system beacuse if you don't you will end up with a system that does'nt meet the users needs.

My apporach to development was to take my time in each step of the process. rushing would only lead to a rushed product , of lower qualty.
